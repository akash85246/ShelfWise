<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **PostgreSQL**: Install and configure PostgreSQL for database management ([Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)).
- **npm or yarn**: Comes with Node.js; used to install project dependencies.
- **Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the repository.
- **Render Account**: If deploying on Render, create a free account at [Render](https://render.com).
- **Google Cloud Project**: Set up a Google Cloud project for Google Authentication ([Guide](https://developers.google.com/identity)).
- **Open Library API**: No additional setup required, but familiarize yourself with their API if needed ([Open Library API Docs](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers)).

Ensure you also have a basic understanding of the following:
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic views.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design adjustments.

    BASE_URL=your_base_url
   ```
4. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
5. Run the Project
    ```sh
